    try whenever possible use varibles if have 2 or more values equals
    in this week i saw in video a library called CS'50 but it was not avaible, os why not make myself library?
    so i did it first the method get_int() i learned more about pointers and atoi, scanf methods.

    after much pain and suffering, i make it function with fgets and atoi. and make directories for more mantainability.
    it was difficult learn more about pointers and types of values but i did't.
    i made a Makefile to compile more simply.

    i made the section_one exercise with two possibilities: one declaring char before and fgets to do it more eficiency. and made with mylib get_int method, for more leability.

    the do method dont ask anything before execute it.

    i try make get_string using on mylib, but do not working.
